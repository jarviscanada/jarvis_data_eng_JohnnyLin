**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JohnnyLin/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent using Bash scripts that manages and stores hardware specifications and resource usage data of nodes in a cluster. The agent utilizes the crontab scheduler to execute every minute. The data is managed by a PostgreSQL database that is provisioned using Docker.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JohnnyLin/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: Developed a Grep application that imitates the grep command on Linux. The app searches files for lines matching the provided regular expression and stores the matched lines in a file. The search begins at the specified directory and recursively searches all directories and files. Implemented using IntelliJ IDE, Core Java and Maven. Deployed with Docker.
  - JDBC App: In progress
